    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tribalism is something I would like to discuss about. Tribalism is the
extension of our ancient tribal lives into our modern world. Infact
most edifices of this world is based on our tribal socieities
thousands of years ago. Globalization is only improving commerce, but
our tribal feelings still remain. Tribalism can be manifested in the
desire of dividing people into groups or tribes. Those that base their
divisions on classification based on history, ancient human tribes,
civilization, etc. is tribalism. Country, patriotism, racism,
religion, fanaticism, are all examples of tribalism.</p>

<p><strong>Country</strong> Modern extension of ancient kindgoms, which in turn
extends from tribes.</p>

<p><strong>Race</strong> Another term for tribe but in the wider sense. In a sense it
unites some tribes with common properties and moulds them into groups.</p>

<p><strong>Fanaticism</strong> derives from religion which in turn derives from tribal
rituals and which ultimately derives from tribes.</p>

<p>The force of tribalism is the most powerful of all human group
forces. This force still haunts mankind, and doesn&rsquo;t seem to go away
very soon. With tribalism still dominating as one of the major forces
in this world, it would be wise to analyze, the force that affects
tribal dynamics. Group theory, that observes the dynamics of people in
various groups, can be applied to tribalism also. Hence, it can be
said that one tribe can show the same manisfestations as that of a
group. So, one tribe always wants the disadvantage of other tribes,
and advantage of oneself.</p>

<p>There are other laws also which I think control tribal dynamics.
Tribes like to establish superiority over other tribes. Tribes like to
take credit for ancient civilizations and for all the glory to mankind
they&rsquo;ve brought, but discredit other tribes and their achievements. A
tribe can be united by using various definitions like nation,
religion, race, creed, etc. But mostly tribal feelings are glorified
by achievements that a particular tribe has already achieved.</p>

<p>History is written by the tribes which has the most power during the
time in which history was written. Sadly, tribal forces still affect
our society so that powerful tribes enjoy and weaker tribes
suffer. People are still not treated equally. Actually tribal feelings
imply inequality.</p>

<p>Therefore, we finally arrive at the ultimate thing that shapes our
world <strong>POWER</strong>. The powerful tribe will live prosperously, glorify
their history, glorify their pride and unquestionably write a new
chapter in history. This is the condition of our world.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This blog will contain my thoughts or whatever comes to my mind. They
will not be written in an ordered manner but instead whenever they&rsquo;ll
arrive in my mind. There are various things that come to my mind, as a
result of observation or analysis. Not recorded they are <strong>lost
forever</strong>. But still this blog isn&rsquo;t written to reach the conclusion
of recording thoughts. Instead it has no conclusion at all.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am blogging via <strong>Octopress</strong> using <strong>Github Pages</strong>.  Writing my posts using
<strong>Emacs</strong> (to be specific <strong>org-mode</strong> and not <strong>markdown</strong>), and writing
math-equations using <strong>Mathjax</strong> $\zeta(s) = \sum \frac{1}{n^s}$ Isn&rsquo;t this super fishy!</p>
